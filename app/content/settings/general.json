So, once you purchase the course, you’ll have lifetime access to all the material.\n\nThis is beneficial especially if you’re not sure how much time you’ll have for your lessons and you don’t want to feel pressure to finish the course in less than a month.\n\nAfter the purchase, you’ll get 9 interactive eBooks, 500 audios, and 200 video lessons.\n\nPianoforall also keeps making updates so you’ll always have fresh content.\n\nThe platform also has a 60-day money-back guarantee.\n\n**Pianoforall Requirements**\n\nTo access Pianoforall lessons you’ll just need your device and a piano or a keyboard.\n\nYou can access Pianoforall eBooks on Windows computer, Mac, iPhone, iPad, or any Android device.\n\nIf you use a computer or Mac, you’ll need Adobe Reader and Flash player to access tutorials, videos, and audio lessons.\n\nFor iOS, you’ll have to install the Readdle Documents app. If you have an Android device, you’ll need the EZPDF Reader lite app (it costs $1).\n\nOnce you download the program, you can access it anytime and anywhere you want – yes, offline!

You just need to ask for your free lessons and you’ll get them in your e-mail.\n\n**Meet Your Instructor**\n\nThe creator and piano teacher of Pianoforall lessons is a well-known cartoonist and talented pianist Robin Hall. He launched his method online in 2006 and since then he is a full-time piano instructor.\n\nHe plays both keyboard and grand piano, meaning that in his teaching, he combines classical piano playing and showing tunes on the keyboard.\n\nIn his video lessons, he explains musical concepts with a calm approach and in a clear, comprehensible way.\n\nHall doesn’t cover all the music theory you would learn in a traditional piano school but doesn’t completely avoid it either. We’ll dig deeper into the program’s content in a moment.\n\n**Pianoforall Method**\n\nThe Pianoforall method is based on teaching how to play the piano through two main things.\n\nOne of them is the rhythm piano. Robin Hall aims to teach basic rhythm patterns quite soon in the course, and as you progress, you’ll learn more complex rhythms.\n\nAnother element that Hall puts focus on is the chord progression. By learning chords and chord progressions, you’ll soon be able to play familiar songs.\n\nBy teaching rhythm and chords, you’ll get a grasp of playing the piano pretty easily, and you’ll also be able to apply it to various songs – even your own!\n\nHowever, the program doesn’t neglect notation, which is a crucial part of learning how to play the piano well. If you learn notes and sight-reading, you’ll be free to play anything you want.\n\n![Piano and musical notation.](https://middermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27.png \"Pianoforall Review - Is It Worth It? 2\")\n\nTo teach you how to read notes, Pianoforall uses a unique and effective combination of keyboard diagrams, notation, audio, and video.\n\nThat way, you’ll learn notes by the so-called visual association – you’ll learn it first by diagrams and then see what it looks like in [musical notation](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/music-101-what-is-musical-notation-learn-about-the-different-types-of-musical-notes-and-time-signatures).\n\nWith Pianoforall, you’ll learn how to play by ear as well as read sheet music. It’s a good method for learning how to play the piano quickly but also properly.\n\n**Audio and Video Lessons**\n\nThe Pianoforall course offers 200 video and audio lessons – you can access them from the interactive eBooks.\n\nYou can simply click on the audio lesson to hear what you’re reading about.\n\nIn the videos, you can see Hall playing and explaining the material. As he demonstrates the techniques, you’ll be able to see hand placements, fingerings, and overall movements that you can mirror.\n\nThe course comes with a total of 500 audio clips and exercises, which is truly an abundance of learning material.\n\nThere are many short exercises ideal for double-checking what you’ve learned.\n\n![Pianoforall learning interface.](https://middermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-28.png \"Pianoforall Review - Is It Worth It? 3\")",
